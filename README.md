## Simple Demos for p5
The original files in this repo were used for the 'Intro to Generative Art' demo at the unofficial DevFest 2016.

## How to Use

Simply download the entire repo and open the `index.html` file to view a sketch. The p5 sketches are in the `\views` folder. `lib` holds the p5 libraries. Modify the following line of html in `index.html` to point to whatever p5js sketch you would like to demo.
`<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="views/basics.js"></script>`

## More p5

These sketches were produced for an in-person demonstration, and are maintained here primarily for the benefit of attendees.

The p5 documentation is excellent! You should check it out by visiting the [p5 homepage](https://p5js.org/).
